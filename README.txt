To run this program in the terminal
These instructions will assume that the file "CSC_499_Homework_1" is on the desktop with the files
lengthAlphaSort.py
Sort Me.txt (this file was copy pasted from the Resources provided, just wanted fewer files when 
		submiting)
And this tutorial will be done in the MacOS terminal, but the commands should still be the same
1. Open the terminal
2. Run command "cd Desktop"
3. Run Command "cd CSC_499_Homework_1"
4. Run Command "python3 lengthAlphaSort.py"

After running those commands a text document called "sorted.txt" should be created with a list of
	the names in the "Sort Me.txt" file sorted first by length, and then by Alphabetical
In the terminal there will also be a printed list of the Array that was used to sort them in the 
	python file. 

Update 1.1: Added User Input and Reverse Sorting
	Sorts can now be First in Length of Name, then in Alphabetical

	To run the File now, you would follow the Steps above and there you will be Prompted with 
	"Would you like your sort to be Reversed? Y/N"
	After entering either Y for Yes and N for No the program will run and generate a file named
	"sorted.txt" which will house your sorted list. 

	You will also see the list printed out in your command line.
